# Hearthstone
A simple PyOpenGL project to visualise possible lines of play in a game of Hearthstone. 

To run this successfully, run hearthpwnscraper.py followed by renamescript.py. This will download all of the required images, and name them as required by the program. After this, run main2.py and the program should run successfully.
